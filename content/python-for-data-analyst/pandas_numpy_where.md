description: Difference between pandas.where() and numpy.where()
---

My first two lines of Python code are almost always "import pandas as pd" and "import numpy as np". They have lots of methods that share the same name, and where() is one of them that I use very often. They are both if...else... function, but there are some difference and this post will explain the difference.
