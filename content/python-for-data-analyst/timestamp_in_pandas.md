### **Instantiation**
Timestamp in Pandas is similar to Pythonâ€™s Datetime objects, but Pandas's Timestamp is more flexible when it comes to instantiation. 
For example, the following code does the same thing to return a Timestamp('2018-01-05 00:00:00'):
```
pd.Timestamp("2018-01-05")
pd.Timestamp("01-05-2018")
pd.Timestamp("01 05 2018")
pd.Timestamp("2018/01/05")
```
But I would stick with one format, for example, "2018-01-05".

It is also convenient to get the Timestamp of right now:
```
pd.Timestamp("today")
```

Using key word arguments will also work, for example:
```
pd.Timestamp(year=2020, month=9, day=1)
```

### **Functions I Use Frequently**
I use the following three methods with Timestamp the most frequently.
1. **date()** will convert a Timestamp to date, for example:
```
pd.Timestamp('2021-09-01').date()
```
2. **normalize()** will zero time part, for example, if we have a Timestamp('2021-10-12 06:33:30.793655'), once normalized() is called it will become Timestamp('2021-10-12 00:00:00'):
```
pd.Timestamp('2021-10-12 06:33:30.793655').normalize()
```
3. **replace()** will replace the date/time part, for example:
```
pd.Timestamp("2018/01/05").replace(month=9)
```
replace the month from January to September and return Timestamp('2018-09-05 00:00:00')
```
pd.Timestamp('2021-10-12 06:33:30.793655').replace(second=0)
```
will replace second from 30 to 0 and return Timestamp('2021-10-12 06:33:00.793655').

### **Some Useful Attributes**
Same as datetime objects, dot notation will get the attributes of Timestamps for you.
I use the following attributes the most:
```
pd.Timestamp("today").year
pd.Timestamp("today").month
pd.Timestamp("today").day
pd.Timestamp("today").dayofweek
pd.Timestamp("today").dayofyear
pd.Timestamp("today").quarter
...
```
