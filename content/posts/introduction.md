description: A brief introduction of this blog
---

This is my GitHub page where I post things that might be helpful for data analysts who regularly use Python and Excel. 

The content will focus on specific functions or libraries in Python that are commonly used in my daily work.

I will keep each blog as short as 1 to 3 minutes reading so that if anyone would read it, they don't get bored before finishing reading. :-)
