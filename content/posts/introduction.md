description: A brief introduction of this blog
---

This is my GitHub page where I post things that might be helpful for data analysts who want to learn some Python.

The content will focus on specific functions or libraries in Python that I am using in my daily work.

I will keep each blog as short as 1 to 3 minutes reading so that if anyone would read it, they don't get bored before finishing reading. :-)

My self-introduction can be found on this [page]({{< ref "/content/addons/author.md" >}}).
