description: A brief introduction of this blog
---

This is my GitHub page where I post things that might be helpful for data analysts who regularly use Python and Excel. 

The content will focus on specific functions, or libraries that are commonly used among data analysts, especially for those who deal with time series data. I may not include too much about the basics of programming and Python. 

I will keep each blog as short as 3 to 5 minutes reading so if anyone would read it, they don't get bored before finishing reading. :-)
